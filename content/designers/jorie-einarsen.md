course: Graphic Design
introduction: Jorie is a London based multidisciplinary designer from Sweden's
  archipelago. She is passionate, curious and driven, with a strong focus on
  editorial, typography, contemporary graphic design and print media, including
  RISO printing. A common feature in her work is a playful element that invites
  the audience to engage and have fun with it. Her work is bright, colourful and
  tactile — wether it be in digital or printed form — and she often explores
  beyond traditional formats in her process.  After her foundation studies in
  Graphic Design at Berghs School of Communication in Stockholm, she moved to
  London where she pursued her BA in Graphic Design. She is now looking onwards
  for engaging and creative challenges to further hone her skills in printed
  media and contemporary graphic design.
