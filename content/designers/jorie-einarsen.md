course: Graphic Design
introduction: Jorie is a London based multidisciplinary designer from Sweden's
  archipelago. She is passionate, curious and driven, with a strong focus on
  editorial, typography, contemporary graphic design and print media, including
  RISO printing. A common feature in her work is a playful element that invites
  the audience to engage and have fun with it. Her work is bright, colourful and
  tactile — wether it be in digital or printed form — and she often explores
  beyond traditional formats in her process.  After her foundation studies in
  Graphic Design at Berghs School of Communication in Stockholm, she moved to
  London where she pursued her BA in Graphic Design. She is now looking onwards
  for engaging and creative challenges to further hone her skills in printed
  media and contemporary graphic design.

  - title: BLOOPS
    description: The ‘Bloops’ clock is designed to evoke calmness and enforces the
      viewer to slowly reflect on each moment of time as if it were an artwork.
      It brings colour and playfulness to your environment and provides a calm
      and novel way to view time — in contrast to the cold, sterile and purely
      functional clockfaces we have become accustomed to.  This project is still
      in a conceptual stage, and Jorie is aiming realise this into a fully
      working digital clock for desktop and mobile during late summer 2021.

  - title: Experimenting With A Risograph Without Using It
    description: A printed editorial booklet that takes the observer on a journey
      through various RISO experiments, alongside the different components of
      the printer itself. As a final major project, Jorie detailed her process
      on extracting inks from discarded RISO masters, to then preserve and
      repurpose the scraps in a contemporary piece. The experimental phase of
      this project produced 197.6 grams of extracted inks from 299 discarded
      RISO masters.

  - title: Where's Brian?
    description: "A printed editorial mini-book that juxtaposes a part of Eve
      Ensler's 'The Vagina Monologues' with old portrait photographs of male
      students from the 1970’s-1980’s, representing the different personas of
      Brian. The new narrative is solely based on one of the questions Ensler
      asks when interviewing women: “If your vagina could talk, what would it
      say, in two words?” — where one of the answers was “Where’s Brian?”. Hence
      the title of this book."
