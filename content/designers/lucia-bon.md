  - title: Lingotime
    description: "Lingotime is a card game and a fun and engaging way to learn
      expressions in other languages. The phrases are related to time and are
      literal translations to English. The aim of the game is to guess the
      meaning of the sayings, and to collect the most Expression cards. "

  - title: Dilemmas of Sustainable Graphic Design
    description: For my final major project, I explored the ways we can achieve
      sustainability in design whilst accepting that there isn't one correct
      answer. I put my research into an editorial as an informative book for
      other designers and consumers, but presenting the contradictions we find
      ourselves in when designing sustainably.
