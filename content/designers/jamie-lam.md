course: Graphic Design
introduction: Jamie is a London based designer and art director with a keen eye
  for detail in typography and editorial work, always trying to find solutions
  for digital and physical design briefs.  He loves to work with the physical
  side of design, where the focus on tactility and interaction with an audience
  is just as important as the concept and aesthetics.  Professionalism and
  attention to detail are a few things that Jamie likes to obsess over, making
  sure each brief outcome is up to an industry standard.
