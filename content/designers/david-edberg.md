  - title: "Love Addicts "
    video: ""
    description: "Love Addicts is a very personal project that tries to spread
      awareness surrounding drug addiction. Drug addicts are a massively under
      represented group, ostracised from society with a lot of misconceptions
      and hate surrounding them. With the general discourse surrounding addicts,
      being generally so negative, I want my project to be sort of a love letter
      of awareness to drug addicts. "

  - title: Futureproofing a Graphic Designer
    description: "I chose to write my dissertation about what Graphic Designers can
      do to futureproof themselves in an ever-changing global economy. I
      surveyed 54 graphic designers that I personally look up to, in order to
      gather some useful tips and did some extensive secondary research to be
      able to create \"The Graphic Designer's Guide to Futureproofing\". Going
      into the industry, I wanted to set myself up for as much success as
      possible and with the crazy state of the world and the economy I wanted to
      know what impact it had on the industry. "

      Not being from the UK, I also miss a place that I could go to celebrate
      his life and mourn his passing. "
