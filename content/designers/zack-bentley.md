introduction: Zack is a graphic designer from South East London. He is

  creative mediums in which to convey his ideas. He is focused on solving
  creative problems in innovative ways and pushes himself to develop ideas and
  solutions, whilst being quick to implement these.  He has a love for working
  in print due to the physicality it brings to design and spends a lot of time
  creating new editorial layouts that both challenge him and further his
