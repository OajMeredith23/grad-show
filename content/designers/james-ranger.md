introduction: James is an up and coming creative working with design, art and
  photography to build complex and thought-provoking projects. James enjoys
  tackling important and relevant social issues within our society from
  institutional racism within the police, to the psychology of parasocial
  relationships and fandom in the digital age. This is combined with stunning
  visuals created using mixed media techniques and an emphasis on image creation
  and manipulation.

  - title: Holloway Boys 1983
    description: Holloway Boys 1983 – Inspired by police incident reports, this
      typeface along with a series of type specimen posters tells the story of
      my dad’s experience with racism at the hands of the police in the ’80s. I
      wanted to build a typeface that emphasises the systematic and repetitive
      nature of cases where police have leveraged their power through brutality
      or silence in racist ways.
