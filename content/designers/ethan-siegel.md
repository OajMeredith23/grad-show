introduction: "Ethan is a mature, passionate designer specialising in
  advertising and brand communications. With strong feelings towards ongoing
  social issues, his work often explores the ethics, sustainability and
  responsibility of design in a global situation, utilising design as a tool to
  educate and inform. In some instances emphasizing the importance of function
  within design over form, as such seen in Futura Sustained, which leaves us to
  question the relationship between aesthetic and responsibility. He has
  acquired professional experience at various studios, working on projects for
  global companies which include: Smirnoff, Johnnie Walker, Primark, Balabala
  and more."
