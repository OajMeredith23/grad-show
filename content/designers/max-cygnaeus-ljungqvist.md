course: Graphic Design
introduction: Max is a multidisciplinary graphic designer based in London who is
  passionate about solving problems through design. He especially enjoys working
  with typography, web design, motion graphics, and branding. Max's approach to
  design and communication comes from an explorative position, always asking why
  and what rather than how. He is a firm believer in taking personal
  responsibility for everything you do and create, and tries to bring that to
  all his projects.

    title: "I am Angry: The Fragile Egos of Men"
    description: "This booklet was based on the concept of fragile masculinity, and
      the patriarchy's role in society's gender norms. I chose to name this
      booklet 'The Fragile Egos of Men: I am Angry'. The perspective is
      reflected in the bold typeface and layout, with harsh contrasting colours,
      and striking imagery of hyper masculinity."
