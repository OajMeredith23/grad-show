  - title: Accidents of the Soul
    description: "These illustrations were created in response to a brief based on
      one word: Time. I wanted to create pieces of art that expressed the
      passage of time depending on the emotion a person is feeling. I created
      four illustrations based on seperate emotions: happiness, sadness, boredom
      and pleasure. The title of these artworks comes from the idea that before
      we had the word emotions all we had were accidents of the soul. "

  - title: Incipit
    description: "Based on my love of reading, I created a website that is made up
      of some of my favourite books and recommends them to the user with only
      their dedications and opening sentences. It is an attempt to incite
      interest in these books in an unconventional way. This also limits
      prejudice on deciding whether or not you'll like a book wether it be from
      the cover, title, author or genre. It also ties in with my interest in
      helping to keep independent bookshops alive by connecting the purchase
      link for the books on the website to another site that supports local and
      independent book sellers. "
