  - title: SHIPYARD - Typeface
    description: "‘Shipyard’ is a typeface designed and projected by Jay Halim
      Davison, inspired by the effects of the declining industrial industries
      and Thatcherism in the North East of England.   The final type specimen
      was projected on structures from Newcastle to Middlesbrough, in key
      locations that were once significant with the Shipbuilding and steel
      industry across the world.   Made up from a combination of three fonts
      including Helvetica Bold, Eurostile Bold and Microgramma D Bold Extended,
      the typeface is a representation of classic ship typography. Using Glyphs
      to generate extrusions that mimic crane-like structures, Shipyard is a
      usable and variable typeface. "

  - title: Canny Curries
    description: "Canny Curries is a family recipe and story book designed by Jay
      Halim Davison.  The book features elements of illustration, considered
      typography and photography.     The book is focused around Jay’s family
      history and mixed Bengali, British heritage. Canny Curries follows a
      journey that Jay’s grandparents took from Newcastle to Bangladesh in a
      converted ford transit van, with their 5 children in 1969.   The editorial
      features memories and stories told by Jay’s mother, Rashida and her
      sisters Anwara, Yasmine and Mimi about their trip to Bangladesh. The book
      also gives an insight into growing up mixed race, in Newcastle during the
      60’s and 70’s. Of course it wouldn’t be a recipe book without Rashida’s 10
      delicious curries, told step by step with tips and advice passed down from
      her father, Majid. "
