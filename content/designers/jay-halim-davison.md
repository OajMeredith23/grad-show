  - title: SHIPYARD - Typeface
    description: "‘Shipyard’ is a typeface designed and projected by Jay Halim
      Davison, inspired by the effects of the declining industrial industries
      and Thatcherism in the North East of England.   The final type specimen
      was projected on structures from Newcastle to Middlesbrough, in key
      locations that were once significant with the Shipbuilding and steel
      industry across the world.   Made up from a combination of three fonts
      including Helvetica Bold, Eurostile Bold and Microgramma D Bold Extended,
      the typeface is a representation of classic ship typography. Using Glyphs
      to generate extrusions that mimic crane-like structures, Shipyard is a
      usable and variable typeface. "
