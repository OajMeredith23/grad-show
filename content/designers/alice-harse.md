title: Alice Harse
course: Graphic Design
introduction: Highly concept driven, my passion for graphic design is rooted in
  an urge to question and contextualise visual imagery across mediums.  My
  previous projects have explored theories of consumerism and decolonialisation
  of graphic design, and topics such as music, fashion and  internet culture.
