    description: Ground Zero is an experimental, journal-like editorial that
      explores the concepts and issues surrounding culture shock, with a
      specific focus on London. Visualising the designer's personal experience
      through playfulness and humour, the editorial takes the reader on a
      journey through 3 different phases of culture shock, with a goal of
      shedding light and positivity on a rather difficult transitional process.

  - title: PALMYRA
    description: "Palmyra is a typeface designed with  the fusion of a modern Latin
      typeface with characteristics of classic Arabic calligraphic elements. The
      type specimen utilises satire to address Arab stereotypes in the West
      through the depiction of Orientalist distortions and the commercialisation
      of ethnic property. "
