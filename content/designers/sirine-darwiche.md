    description: Ground Zero is an experimental, journal-like editorial that
      explores the concepts and issues surrounding culture shock, with a
      specific focus on London. Visualising the designer's personal experience
      through playfulness and humour, the editorial takes the reader on a
      journey through 3 different phases of culture shock, with a goal of
      shedding light and positivity on a rather difficult transitional process.
