course: Graphic Design
introduction: "Born and raised in New York City, art has always been an integral
  part of my life! Starting with drawing and fine art, and eventually moving
  into graphic design, being creative is what I do best. After graduating from
  LaGuardia High School of Music & Art in 2018, I moved to London to continue my
  studies at Ravensbourne University. "

  - title: "Morningstar: The Average Sinner's Guide to Hell"
    description: "The concept of the project stemmed from research into Hell as a
      concept throughout history. However, the inspiration to even tackle this
      subject came from the desire to reclaim Hell, as the idea of “going to
      Hell” is so often weaponized against LGBTQIA+ people. "

  - title: The Pantsuit Pantry
    description: The Pansuit Pantry is an interactive web experience inspired by the
      fantastically fabulous pantsuits of Dolly Parton. As a Dolly Parton fan,
      these are some of my favorite looks, but I was distraught by the fact that
      they didn’t exist anywhere together as an archive. So when we were set
      this brief, I knew it was time to tackle the challenge.
