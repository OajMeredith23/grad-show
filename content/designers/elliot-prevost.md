title: Elliot Prevost
course: Graphic Design
introduction: Elliot is an enthusiastic, passionate and mature designer with an
  eagerness to learn and evolve into the best designer he can be. With a strong
  interest in popular culture such as sports, music and film a lot of his recent
  work reflects these interests in a range of different types of outcomes,
  whether it is typography, UI, information design or other outcomes. In every
  example he is very focused on producing contextually informed and effective
  design within every piece of work including those outside of these personal
  interests. As a versatile designer he values the importance of developing and
  producing each individual project with the appropriate tools and skills that
  best compliment the project at hand.
