    description: In order to help people understand what synesthesia is I created a
      book that highlights a series of visual experiments that aim to trigger
      people brains into imagining certain areas of the trait. By Incorporating
      a series of visual outcomes that were created by combining two senses not
      normally associated it aims to make people open their minds to a new way
      of seeing things. Throughout the book I explored the main senses and found
      ways to allow the reader to engage with ebook using them. As synesthesia
      differs from person to person I wanted to allow for each person to use
      their brain to see an outcome to allow for more of a variety into
      experiencing synesthesia.
  - title: Time
    description: "The sun has been used throughout history as a way to navigate
      time, mainly using the suns rays in union with other objects as well as
      plotting the position of the sun to tell time.   This project aims to
      combine the idea of freezing time with exploring how light is manipulated
      by objects throughout the day therefore highlighting the unseen effects of
      time.  Each print can then be explored through the website showing the
      different levels of light, as well as the angle the light was held at and
      what time of day this was meant to represent.    link:
