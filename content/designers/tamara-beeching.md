    description: In order to help people understand what synesthesia is I created a
      book that highlights a series of visual experiments that aim to trigger
      people brains into imagining certain areas of the trait. By Incorporating
      a series of visual outcomes that were created by combining two senses not
      normally associated it aims to make people open their minds to a new way
      of seeing things. Throughout the book I explored the main senses and found
      ways to allow the reader to engage with ebook using them. As synesthesia
      differs from person to person I wanted to allow for each person to use
      their brain to see an outcome to allow for more of a variety into
      experiencing synesthesia.
